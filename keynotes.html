            <strong>Keynote title:</strong>
            <em>AI in Forensic Biometrics: the two sides of the medal</em>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The forensic process supports several forensic biometric applications: intelligence, investigation and evaluation in court. It aims at answering forensic questions about the source of biometric items and about the reconstruction of activities (e.g. type, location, time and sequence) involving biometric items. Concretely the process consists in examining (i.e. recovering, analysing and interpreting) biometric items, and in answering the questions by reporting the observations made and the opinions formulated.</p>
          <p>The rapid development and widespread use of artificial intelligence in society also affects forensic biometrics. This keynote lecture presents the generative (GenAI) and discriminative (DisAI) applications derived from artificial intelligence models that are playing a role in forensic biometrics.</p>
          <p>On one side it explains the use of GenAI to produce artificial forensic biometric items (e.g. morphing, deepfakes). On the other side, it describes the use of GenAI and DisAI in the recovery, analysis, interpretation and reporting steps of the forensic biometrics process. Finally it explores the accountability requirements for a forensic biometric process embedding GenAI and DisAI, from a scientific, legal, and societal perspective.</p>
          <p><strong>Short bio:</strong> Didier shares his time between the Netherlands Forensic Institute, where he is a principal scientist and the University of Twente, where he holds the chair of forensic biometrics. He specialises in the probabilistic evaluation of biometric data, the validation of likelihood ratio models and in identity management. Didier has served in several international terrorist and war-crime case reviews on request of ICTY, STL, UN, UK and CH. He has (co-)authored more than 65 peer-reviewed publications in forensic science. He is an associate and guest editor of Forensic Science International, a member of the ENFSI RD standing committee and of the ISO Technical Committee 272.</p>

            <strong>Short bio:</strong>
            Dr. John Howard is a computer scientist specializing in the evaluation of artificial intelligence systems for bias and the impact of automated-system bias on human performance. He has served as principal investigator on numerous research and development efforts across industry and government, and is the former Chief Data Scientist at the U.S. Maryland Test Facility, a leading AI test and evaluation laboratory. He currently serves as editor of ISO/IEC 19795-10 and ISO/IEC 19795-6, the international standards for testing bias in biometric systems and evaluating the performance of deployed biometric technologies. Dr. Howard has acted as an expert witness in legal cases involving data-privacy regulations, patent disputes, and the forensic use of face recognition in the United States, and holds an academic appointment at Southern Methodist University’s AT&T Center.
