      <p>The event will be held in EURECOM, France.</p>

      <h2>Destination South of France</h2>

      <h3>Côte d’Azur</h3>
      <p>
        The Côte d’Azur is known for its Mediterranean climate, offering warm, sun‑filled summers and mild winters that draw tourists from around the globe. 
        The region is synonymous with luxury, boasting high‑end resorts, gourmet dining experiences, and exclusive shops selling designer merchandise. 
        Glamour permeates the air, especially during the Cannes Film Festival, when movie stars and celebrities descend upon the coastline, adding a touch of Hollywood sparkle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yachts are a common sight in the turquoise waters, a testament to the affluent lifestyle that has become a hallmark of the Côte d’Azur. 
        The region's azure skies, charming Provençal villages, and lavender fields paint a picture of quintessential French beauty. 
        There's also an intriguing blend of tradition and modernity in the area, with historic architecture sitting side by side with contemporary art galleries and museums. 
        With its vibrant nightlife and rich cultural offerings, the Côte d’Azur is truly an embodiment of French elegance and joie de vivre.
      </p>

      <h3>Antibes</h3>
      <p>
        Nestled between Nice and Cannes, Antibes is a historic seaside town famed for its 16th‑century ramparts and the Picasso Museum housed in the former Château Grimaldi. Stroll through the winding lanes of the Old Town to discover lively Provençal markets, craft boutiques, and pastel‑coloured facades. The Port Vauban marina—Europe’s largest pleasure boat harbor—teems with luxury yachts against a backdrop of sandy beaches and the sparkling Mediterranean. Antibes combines centuries‑old charm with vibrant cafés, seaside promenades, and a calendar of cultural events, making it an essential stop on the Côte d’Azur.
