      <h2>About IWBF 2026</h2>
      <p>
        The 2026 International Workshop on Biometrics and Forensics (IWBF 2026) will be held on April 23–24, 2026 at EURECOM on the beautiful Côte d’Azur (French Riviera).  
        IWBF is an international forum devoted to fostering collaboration in multimedia forensics, forensic biometrics, and forensic science.  
        Leading‑edge research in biometrics, surveillance, multimedia forensics, and related areas will be presented.  
        The 14th edition of IWBF brings together industry, academia, research, and end‑users exploring advanced biometric technologies for forensic applications.

    <!-- Contribution Options -->
    <section>
      <h2>Your Contribution Options</h2>

      <h3>Regular Papers</h3>
      <p>
        Regular papers present original research contributions that advance the state of the art in biometrics, forensics,
        and related areas. Submissions should include comprehensive experimental validation, clear methodology, and
        well-supported conclusions. Accepted papers will be presented orally or as posters, depending on their content and
        review outcomes.
      </p>

      <h3>Position Papers</h3>
      <p>
        Position papers present well-reasoned arguments or perspectives on current or emerging topics in biometrics and
        forensics. They are analytical and thought-provoking, aiming to influence how the community approaches specific
        challenges, methods, or policies. These papers may not include extensive experimental results but should be
        grounded in existing research and provide clear justification for the authors’ stance or proposal. Their goal is to
        spark informed debate and reflection on present issues and directions in the field.
      </p>

      <p>Requirements for Authors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A Position Paper should begin with a clear and direct statement of the author's viewpoint or proposal on the topic.</li>
        <li>The paper should rely on objective facts, cite reliable research, and present expert opinions to both support its claims and refute opposing ones.</li>
        <li>The paper should propose strategies to address a problem and present a proposal with at least a preliminary, though not thorough, evaluation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Blue Sky Papers</h3>
      <p>
        Blue Sky papers aim to inspire bold and imaginative thinking about the long-term future of biometrics and
        forensics. They present visionary, high-risk, or unconventional ideas that may challenge current assumptions and
        open entirely new research avenues. While speculative in nature, Blue Sky papers should offer plausible reasoning
        and conceptual soundness. Their purpose is not to argue a position on current debates, but to propose transformative
        possibilities that could shape the field in the years ahead.
      </p>

      <p>Requirements for Authors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A Blue Sky paper should begin with a clear and direct statement of the author's viewpoint or idea.</li>
        <li>The paper could not rely on objective facts related to the present technological and/or sociological context, but should rely on a strong scientific argument.</li>
        <li>The presented research could not have a clear, immediate "real-world" application, but it investigates feasible new trends and possibilities.</li>
        <li>Proponents should convince the reader that the proposed idea is crucial for leading to unpredictable, valuable breakthroughs.</li>
      </ul>
